## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is my first Frontend Mentor challenge. Needless to say, I learned a lot from it. I did not know how to apply a hover property in CSS until this project. I took the opportunity to use grid and flex in this project as well to layout the area with the icons and text.


### Continued development

I need to continue to refine my skill with proper planning, positioning and writing concise code.


### Useful resources

- https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/ - CSS tricks was a significant help in planning and gaining an understanding on how I could utilize grid for this project. The descriptions and visualizations give a basic overview of the different properties and how they will influence your layout. I found it to be very helpful in addition to MDN Web Docs.
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position - This was normally my first stop if I got stuck. However, the content here can get deeper than I am needing. That is when I would search for other tutorials or resources such as CSS Tricks listed above. The combination of these two resources was extraordinarily helpful in completing this project.
